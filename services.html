    <p class="p">
    We agree to provide you with the BuzzTalk Service. 
    The Service includes all of the BuzzTalk products, features, applications, services, technologies, 
    and software that 
    we provide to advance buzz talkâ€™s mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. 
    The Service is made up of the following aspects:

   <li type="circle" ><p class="p"><u><b>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.</b></u></p></li>
   <p class="p">  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. 
    So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help 
    you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. 
    Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, 
    and offering ways for you to experience Buzztalk, based on things you and others do on and off Buzztalk.
   </p>
   <li type="circle"><p class="p"><u><b>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</b></u></p></li>
   <p class="p">
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. 
    We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. 
    We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. 
    We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement.
   </p>
   <li type="circle"><p class="p"><u><b>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.</b></u></p></li>
   <p class="p">
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. 
    A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. 
    Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. 
    Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
   </p>
   <li type="circle"><p class="p"><b><u>Ensuring access to our Service.</u></b></p></li>
   <p class="p">
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. 
    The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. 
    This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Karan adekar.
   </p>
   <li type="circle"><p class="p"><u><b>Research and innovation.</b></u></p></li>
   <p class="p">
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our 
    Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
